This file contains information about the automatic windows build of the project via appveyor.

For increasing the speed of the build we use an appveyor premium account in the test phase (which is free for two weeks).
This account should be switched from time to time because of the limited premium trial.

---- The actual premium will expire at:

01.06.2016

---- The actual account is:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tester/amos-ss16-proj3-24y9j

---- The actual dll of the latest working build of the appveyor-deployment (which will be switched later on) can be found (and will be linked in the docker image) at:

https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/tester/amos-ss16-proj3-24y9j/artifacts/doip.dll

---- URL forward to the given URL points to:

doip.tk



The Docker image shows a link to the doip.tk forwarder.
